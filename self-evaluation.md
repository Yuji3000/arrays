I'm not sure how to actively check my work. So I have some confidence in what I'm doing. But sometimes am unsure if what I'm typing is correct or not.

### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I will have to go over the current array lesson at least once more to make sure I'm understanding correctly.


### What questions do you have about Arrays?

 I'm curious what circumstances they're used for.
